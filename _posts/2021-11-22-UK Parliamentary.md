## Question1:what kinds of reserach could people do using the information in Hansard as a resource?

Hansard is the traditional name of the transcripts of Parliamentary debates in Britain and many Commonwealth countries. 
Everything said in the National Assembly - every question, remark and speech - is meticulously recorded by the Parliamentary Reporters,
who represent the acme of the verbatim report-writing profession (The National Assembly, 2017), which is a rich source of contemporary history. 
Through this website, viewers can find members, their contributions, debates, petitions and divisions from published Hansard reports dating back over 200 years. 


Therefore, the Hansard Report serves as the main reference publication for Members of Parliament, Government ministries, scholars and the public at large.
For example, Courts of law refer to the Hansard when they are interpreting Acts of Parliament. 
The Attorney General refers to the Hansard when conirming Acts of Parliament for assent by the President after Parliament has passed a Bill. 
In addition, sociologists, economists and politicians who are deeply concerned conditions of the nation can refer to the Hansard, getting detailed information on all matters touching on the life of the whole nation. 


## Question2:how well does the Hansard website facilitate those kinds of research?

There are two search sections - House of Commons Hansard and House of Lords Hansard - which is prodivied to the public. 
Moreover, viewers can browse/search content/data using variable and useful links such as "browse sitting", 
"find datates ", "find divisions", and "find MPs" to accurately and precisely get detailed information they need.
