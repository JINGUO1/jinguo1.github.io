## Question1:what kinds of reserach could people do using the information in Hansard as a resource?

Hansard is the traditional name of the transcripts of Parliamentary debates in Britain and many Commonwealth countries. 
Accordingly, everything said in the National Assembly - every question, remark and speech - is meticulously recorded by the Parliamentary Reporters,
who represent the acme of the verbatim report-writing profession, which is a rich source of contemporary history. 
Viewers can find Members, their contributions, debates, petitions and divisions from published Hansard reports dating back over 200 years.

Firstly, the Hansard Report serves as the main reference publication for Members of Parliament,
Government ministries and the public at large.  Courts of law refer to the Hansard when they are interpreting Acts of Parliament. 
The Attorney General refers to the Hansard when conirming Acts of Parliament for assent by the President after Parliament has passed a Bill. 
In addition, it provides detailed information on all matters touching on the life of an ordinary citizen.

Besides, they serve as a mirror of the hopes and aspirations, concerns and apprehensions of the nation as voiced by its chosen representatives.
